    <p>Welcome to Dr. Steph's Portfolio. The content and design for this website is being developed as part of my experience in the <a href="http://www.startupinstitute.com">StartUp Institute's</a> New York Web Design and Product Management Track. 
    <br>
    <br>
        While I have dabbled in web design in the past, I have not given it my full attention until now. Before starting this program in NYC, I had been using WordPress to create blogs, but I really wanted to hone in on my web design skills from the ground up. I am also learning that I am very interested in Product Management. </p>
